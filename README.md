# ChatControl Grammar Package for Atom

A simple but useful grammar package for the rule files in the free version of [kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko)'s spigot plugin ChatControl.

You can find it [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol.271/).

## Example

Here some little example for how it may look like:

## Installation

### Command Line

 1. Check you have the newest version of [Atom](https://atom.io)
 2. In the terminal, install the package via apm: 
	 ```sh
	apm install language-mc-chatcontrol
	```

### GUI

 1. Check you have the newest version of [Atom](https://atom.io)
 2. Launch Atom
 3. Open Settings View using <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> on other platforms
 4. Click the Install tab on the left side
 5. Enter `language-mc-chatcontrol` in the search box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
 6. Click the "Install" button that appears

## Usage

To use the grammar package you have to open on the rule files of CC (ChatControl).

 - chat.txt
 - commands.txt
 - packets.txt
 - rules.txt
 - sign.txt

All of them should work automatically but if you want to optimize the decision for Atom add

    # ChatControl Rule File
To the first line of all of these files.

## Author's Note

I personally really love the plugin ChatControl and thought it would be useful to have some grammar for it. I started this private and I think others probably like it to.

Thanks [kangarko](https://github.com/kangarko) for this nice work. ❤
